# Gallery Component - Gradient Animation

The main feature of the Gallery component is its animated gradient background. Here's how it works:

1. The background is created using CSS `linear-gradient()` with four colors.
2. The gradient is sized at 400% in both dimensions, creating a larger canvas than the visible area.
3. An infinite CSS animation called `gradient` is applied:
   - It shifts the background position over 15 seconds.
   - The animation moves the oversized gradient, creating a smooth color transition effect.
4. The `ease` timing function makes the animation appear more natural.

This technique creates a visually engaging, continuously changing background without using any JavaScript or images
